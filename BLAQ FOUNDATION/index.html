                                <li><span>ACTs</span><br>The Affordable Cancer Technologies (ACTs) Program supports innovative research on key scientific issues in global cancer control and leverages unique scientific opportunities afforded by the global collaboration of NCI’s Center for Global Health (CGH).

                                    Prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment are vital to successful cancer control.
                                    
                                    Unfortunately, many established cancer control technologies are not suitable for use in low-resource settings, either globally or in the United States, due to expense or dependency on extensive medical infrastructure. The ACTs Program supports resource-appropriate translational technology research and development for cancer, while ensuring affordability and potential impact in low-resource settings as essential design components.
                                    
                                    The ACTs Program develops technology through every stage, from prototype to clinical implementation studies. Technologies are validated in real-world health settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), leading to additional innovations. Examples of important elements include technologies that can be used by minimally trained health workers, are appropriate at the clinical point of need, or are adaptable to diverse environmental conditions and health systems.
                                    
                                    Please note the ACTS Program does not support exploratory research</li>
                                <li><span>Oncology imaging</span><br>Oncology imaging biomarkers are unique because they can examine and diagnose the exact tumor size and stage. Oncology imaging consists of two main procedures: imaging and diagnosis. Once a suspicious lump is detected through a scan, it has to be diagnosed as either malignant or benign.</li>

With the Young Africa Works strategy, our research and learning will focus on finding new evidence that demonstrates how to address youth unemployment in Africa. Our goal is to catalyze innovation, and build and share evidence that will influence and inspire others to act.

                                Through our research, we identify emerging trends, disruptions, and opportunities to develop evidence to inform policy and our country plans. We will continue to find ways to return evidence to communities, engaging young people in our research and building the capacity of African researchers and evaluators.</p>
